#' Create connection to Silo warehouse and return object to global environment

#' @description This makes a connection to Silo via `RSQLServer`.  This call requires
#' that system environment variable for Silo are set (typically with a an `.Renviron`
#' file in the users home directory that is sourced when R is started).  This
#' function is called for it's side effect: createing a connection object for
#' the named database that can be used by `dplyr` calls in other functions in
#' this package.
